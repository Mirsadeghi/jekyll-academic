## Biography:

Hamid Rezatofighi is a lecturer at Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia. Before that, he was a Senior Research Fellow at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), the University of Adelaide. In 2018, he was awarded a prestigious Endeavour Research Fellowship and used this opportunity for a placement at the Stanford Vision Lab (SVL), Stanford University, directed by Silvio Savarese and Li Fei-Fei.  He received his PhD from the Australian National University in 2015.  He has published over 50 top tier papers in computer vision, AI and machine learning, robotics, medical imaging and signal processing, and has been awarded several grants including the recent ARC discovery 2020 grant. He served as the publication chair in ACCV18 and as one of the area chairs in CVPR20 and WACV21. His research interest includes vision-based perception tasks, esp. those that are required for an autonomous robot to navigate in a human environment, such as object/person detection, multiple object/people tracking, social trajectory forecasting, social activity and human pose prediction and autonomous social robot planning.  He has also research expertise in Bayesian filtering, estimation and learning using point process and finite set statistics and is a pioneer in an emerging field in machine learning, known as set learning using deep neural networks.
